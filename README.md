# Weather Data Analysis
A project of weather events data analysis to assist prioritizing resources.

# Motivation
When major weather events occur, insurance companies often hire outside contractors to assist the claims adjusters due to the large, temporary increase in claims. They are tasked with helping the insurance company decide where to send the contractors in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

# About
As a data science consultant(roleplay), we need to explore and analyze the 2017 storm event data, create a report, and provide recommendations to management (imaginary) regarding where to send the contractors after Hurricane Harvey. I have created a report providing a recommendation on where the insurance company should send people. Also, I have based my recommendation on available data.
